This dataset in this problem only contains two columns--a time index and a target daily temperatures column. Solving this problem as a univariate time series problem lets us build a rich set of features and a useful machine learning model. We can automate the process using both [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com) for time series feature engineering and [EvalML](https://github.com/alteryx/evalml) for performing automated time series regression.

We'll demonstrate several end-to-end workflows, starting with a baseline workflow, then moving to one where we build our features using Featuretools, and finally handling everything inside of EvalML.

## Highlights

- Understand what makes a time series problem different from other machine learning problems
- Show the impact that time series feature engineering has on our model
- Quickly make end-to-end workflow using time series data and time series modeling concepts
- Use AutoMLSearch to perform automated time series machine learning

## Running the tutorial

The data can be found in the `dataset` directory, so the notebook can be run without having to download any additional data.
