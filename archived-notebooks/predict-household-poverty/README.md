**Social programs have a difficult time determining that the right people are given enough aid. Using a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, we'd like to be able to predict the poverty of households.**

We will show how [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com) can be used to predict the poverty of household in Costa Rica using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data) from Kaggle.

*The Tutorial notebook from this repository exists [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/featuretools-for-good). If you would prefer to work in that environment, you can fork the existing kernel to use as a starting point.*

You can find this tutorial on the Featuretools [site](https://www.featuretools.com/project/predict-costa-rican-poverty/).

## Highlights
* Automatically generate 2000 features
* Learn how to write your own primitive to be applied to the data

You can download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data) or create a kernel and use Featuretools there. After downloading, save the CSV to a directory called `data` in the root of this repository.
