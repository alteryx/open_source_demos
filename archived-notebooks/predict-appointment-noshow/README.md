In this tutorial, we show how [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com) can be used to predict whether or not a patient will show up to a scheduled appointment using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) from Kaggle. We make all of the features from the most popular [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/somrikbanerjee/predicting-show-up-no-show) on kaggle, and make some other interesting features automatically.

You can find this tutorial on the Featuretools [site](https://www.featuretools.com/project/predict-appointment-no-show).

## Highlights

* We generate interesting aggregations by age and location automatically.
* We use a secondary time index to generate features from the no-show column without leaking invalid information.
