The Predict Housing Prices dataset on Kaggle is a supervised regression task for which the objective is to predict the sale price of a house based on a series of attributes about the property.

In this tutorial, we use EvalML to preprocess the data as well as define customized pipelines by providing a range of hyperparameters that we want AutoML to iterate over when looking for the pipeline that performs the best at estimating the sale price of a house.

## Highlights

* Understand the data through visualization.
* Perform basic preprocessing.
* Provide a hyperparameter range for our custom pipelines.
* Search for a best performing pipeline based on our objective.
* Review the best pipeline chosen and analyze its performance.

You can download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). After downloading, save the CSV to a directory called `data` in the root of this repository.
