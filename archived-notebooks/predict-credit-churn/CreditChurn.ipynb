Part of the versatility of `AutoMLSearch` is that the built-in preprocessing component can handle some of this by default. Using a OneHotEncoder to break nominal categorical variables into multiple columns is an important step in providing more useful features for models, and that's exactly what `AutoMLSearch` will do for us.\n",

Transforming the data through standardization so that all features are on the same scale is another step that could have been very useful, but since the model families we've chosen to work with are all tree-based, it isn't as important for us in this case.\n",
