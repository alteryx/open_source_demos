In this tutorial, we show how [EvalML](https://github.com/alteryx/evalml) can be used to predict whether or not a customer will end up leaving their bank's credit card service using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers) from Kaggle.

You can find this tutorial on the Featuretools [site](https://www.featuretools.com/project/predict-customer-churn).

## Highlights

* We perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
* We use AutoMLSearch to perform automated machine learning to find the best predictive pipeline.

## Running the tutorial

You can download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers). After downloading, save the CSV to a directory called `data` in the root of this repository.
