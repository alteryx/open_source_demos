**As a bank decides which applicants to provide loans, they may wish to predict if the applicant will default on the loan. Through automated feature engineering, we can identify the predictive patterns in the financial data that can be used to ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected.**

In this tutorial, we show how [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com) can be used to perform feature engineering on a multi-table dataset of 300 thousand applicant financial information provided by Home Credit to train an accurate machine learning model to predict what if an applicant will repay a loan.

You can find this tutorial on the Featuretools [site](https://www.featuretools.com/project/predict-loan-repayment/).

## Highlights

* We automatically generate 1820 features using Deep Feature Synthesis.
* We are able to generate features, check that we are content with those features, and create the feature matrix.
* We develop are able to generate features in 1 hour vs 10 hours with manual feature engineering.

You can download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data). After downloading, save the CSV to a directory called `input` in the root of this repository.
