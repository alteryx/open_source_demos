    "# Introduction: Prediction Engineering: Labeling Historical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will develop a method for labeling customer transactions data for a customer churn prediction problem. The objective of labeling is to create a set of historical examples of what we want to predict based on the business need: in this problem, our goal is to predict customer churn, so we want to create labeled examples of past churn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end outcome of this notebook is a set of labels each with an associated cutoff time in a table called a label times table. These labels with cutoff times can later be used in Featuretools for automated feature engineering. These features in turn will be used to train a predictive model to forecast customer churn, a common need for subscription-based business models, and one for which machine learning is well-suited.\n",

    "The definition of churn is __a customer going without an active membership for a certain number of days.__ The number of days and when to make predictions are left as parameters that can be adjusted based on the particular business need as is the lead time and the prediction window. In this notebook, we'll make labels for two scenarios:\n",

    "1. Monthly churn\n",
    "    * Prediction date = first of month\n",
    "    * Number of days to churn = 31\n",
    "    * Lead time = 1 month\n",

    "2. Bimonthly churn\n",
    "    * Prediction date = first and fifteenth of month\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [data (publicly available)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge/data) consists of customer transactions for [KKBOX](https://www.kkbox.com), the leading music subscription streaming service in Asia.\n",
    "For each customer, we have background information (in `members`), logs of listening behavior (in `logs`), and transactions information (in `trans`). The only data we need for labeling is the _transactions information_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transactions data consists of a number of columns, the most important of which are customer id (`msno`), the date of transaction (`transaction_date`), and the expiration date of the membership (`membership_expire_date`). Using these columns, we can find each churn for each customer and the corresponding date on which it occurred. Let's look at a few typical examples of customer transaction data to illustrate how to find a churn example. For these examples, we will use the first prediction problem.\n",

    "## Churn Examples\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This customer is not a churn. Even though they have a cancelled membership (cancelled on 03-15 and takes effect on 03-16), the membership plan is renewed within 31 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Example 3:__\n",
    "```\n",
    "(transaction_date, membership_expire_date, is_cancel)\n",

    "\n",
    "(2017-10-15, 2017-11-15, false)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This customer is a churn because they go without a membership for over 31 days, from 09-01 to 10-15. The associated cutoff time of this churn in 2017-09-01. \n",
    "\n",
    "These three examples illustrate different situations that occur in the data. Depending on the prediction problem, these may or may not be churns and can be assigned to different cutoff times. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the data above, to find each example of churn, we need to find the difference between one `membership_expire_date` and the next `transaction_date`. If this period is greater than the days selected for a churn, then this is a positive example of churn. For each churn, we can find the exact date on which it occurred by adding the number of days for a churn to the `membership_expire_date` associated with the churn. We create a set of cutoff times using the prediction date parameter and then for each positive label, determine the cutoff time for the churn. As an example, if the churn occurs on 09-15 with a lead time of 1 month and a prediction window of 1 month, then this churn gets the cutoff time 08-01. Cutoff times where the customer was active 1-2 months out (for this problem) will receive a negative label, and, cutoff times where we cannot determine whether the customer was active or was a churn, will not be labeled. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can very rapidly label customer transactions by shifting each `transaction_date` back by one and matching it to the previous `membership_expire_date`. We then find the difference in days between these two (`transaction` - `expire`) and if the difference is greater than the number of days established for churn, this is a positive label. Once we have these positive labels, associating them with a cutoff time is straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this is not clear, we'll shortly see how to do it in code which should clear things up! \n",
    "\n",
    "The general framework is implemented in two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `label_customer(customer_id, transactions, **params)`\n",
    "2. `make_label_times(transactions, **params)` \n",
    "\n",
    "The first takes a single member and returns a table of cutoff times for the member along with the associated labels. The second goes through all of the customers and applies the `customer_to_label_times` function to each one. The end outcome is a single table consisting of the label times for each customer. Since we already partitioned the data, we can run this function over multiple partitions in parallel to rapidly label all the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cutoff Times\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical part of the label times table is the cutoff time associated with each label. This time at which we make a prediction are referred to as _cutoff_ times and they represent when all our data for making features for that particular label must be before. For instance, if our cutoff time is July 1, and we want to make predictions of churn during the month of August, all of our features for this label must be made with data from before July 1. Cutoff times are a critical consideration when feature engineering for time-series problems to prevent data leakage. Later when we go to perform automated feature engineering, Featuretools will automatically filter data based on the cutoff times so we don't have to worry about invalid training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Our overall goal is to build two functions that will generate labels for customers. We can then run this function over our partitions in parallel (our data has been partitioned in 1000 segments, each containing a random subset of customers). Once the label dataframes with cutoff times have been created, we can use them for automated feature engineering using Featuretools.\n"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implemented prediction engineering for the customer churn use case. After defining the business need, we translated it into a task that can be solved with machine learning and created a set of label times. We saw how to define functions with parameters so we could solve multiple prediction problems without needing to re-write the entire code. Although we only worked through two problems, there are numerous others that could be solved with the same data and approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The label times contain cutoff times for a specific prediction problem along with the associated label. The label times can now be used to make features for each label by filtering the data to before the cutoff time. This ensures that any features made are valid and will automatically be taken care of in Featuretools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure for making labels is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the business requirement: predict customers who will churn during a specified period of time\n",
    "2. Translate the business requirement into a machine learning problem: given historical customer data, build a model to predict which customers will churn depending on several parameters\n",
    "3. Make labels along with cutoff times corresponding to the machine learning problem: develop functions that take in parameters so the same function can be used for multiple prediction problems.\n",
    "4. Label all past historical data: parallelize operations by partitioning data into independent subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be extended to other problems. Although the exact syntax is specific to this use case, the overall approach is designed to be general purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "With a complete set of label times, we can now make features for each label using the cutoff times to ensure our features are valid. However, instead of the painstaking and error-prone process of making features by hand, we can use automated feature engineering in [Featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools) to automated this process. Featuretools will build hundreds of relevant features using only a few lines of code and will automatically filter the data to ensure that all of our features are valid. The feature engineering pipeline is developed in the `Feature Engineering` notebook."
